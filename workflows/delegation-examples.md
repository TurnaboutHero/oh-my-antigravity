## Key Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Dependencies
```
Design → Implementation → Testing → Documentation
(Each step needs previous output)
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Independence
```
┌→ Backend (codesmith)
├→ Frontend (pixel)
└→ Database (architect)
(Can all work simultaneously)
```

### Pattern 3: Iterative Refinement
```
Draft (codesmith) → Review (oracle) → Refine (refactorer) → Final
```

### Pattern 4: Quality Gates
```
Implement → Test → Security Audit → Deploy
(Must pass each gate)
```
